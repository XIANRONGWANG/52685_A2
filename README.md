# From Rock to Pop: Coding Emotion Through Music

A creative TunePad project exploring how Python code can generate music by combining **logic, rhythm, and emotion**.

## Overview
Covers the chorus of two popular tracks using Python coding through Tunepad objects (instruments):
- **The White Stripes – “Seven Nation Army”** (Rock: technical precision)  
- **Justin Bieber – “Baby”** (Pop: emotional layering and harmony)

Each `.py` file represents a coded musical part (piano, drums, or octave layer) structured with **loops, functions, and abstraction**.

Tunepad Projects:
1. Seven Nation Army: https://tunepad.com/project/117864
2. Baby: https://tunepad.com/project/117865

## Structure

JB_Baby/      → Emotional pop composition (chorus, octaves)
TWS_SNA/      → Technical rock riff (piano, drums)

```

## Learning Focus and Outcome
- Application of compuational logic expressed through music
- SHowcasing abstraction in case of Tunepad entities modularity in terms of items usage
- Exploring higher and lower octaves by approx 12 semitones to enrich harmony

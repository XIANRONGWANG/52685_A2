# From Rock to Pop: Coding Emotion Through Music

A creative TunePad project exploring how Python code can generate music by combining **logic, rhythm, and emotion**.

## Overview
This project reimagines two iconic songs using computational thinking:
- **The White Stripes – “Seven Nation Army”** (Rock: technical precision)  
- **Justin Bieber – “Baby”** (Pop: emotional layering and harmony)

Each `.py` file represents a coded musical part (piano, drums, or octave layer) structured with **loops, functions, and abstraction**.

## Structure

JB_Baby/      → Emotional pop composition (chorus, octaves)
TWS_SNA/      → Technical rock riff (piano, drums)

```
